# IRCC: a super-simple irc client written in nim

### Compilation

After installing the nim compiler and toolchain, you can compile the client with
```bash
nimble build
```

This produces a debug executable as `./bin/ircc`.  All you have to do now is run it!


### Credits

I never would have ever figured out the important parts of the IRC spec that are implemented today if not for suckless.org's sic client.  Go check it [out](http://git.suckless.org/sic)!
